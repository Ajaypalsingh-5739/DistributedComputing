<h1>LOGIC INTUITION</h1>
1) The algorithm start from the scheduler which takes input as number of procesors from the user and filename associated to  each Processor.</br>
2) It then forks multiple threads which monitors and reads the file associated to each Processor for events and then calls the Processor which handles the event based on the event type.</br>
3) Rest of the flow and interactions should be explanatory from the sequence diagram and class diagram. </br>
